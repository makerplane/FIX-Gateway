Add some tags to indicate some status information so that EFIS displays and
other equipment can have access to that.

Airdata plugin.  This plugin would calculate things like TAS, wind direction
Density altitude etc.  It would also be a good example of a plugin that used
only the callback mechanism instead of needing a thread.

Allow daemonization of the program.

Make item keys in command module case insensitive.

Add commands to start/stop/restart plugins.  Might also add configuration to
load and/or start the plugin.  It could be loaded but not started.  Testing,
simulation and GUI plugins might not always start.

Add annunciation backend.

Maybe a feature to allow plugins to override a value.  It might be helpful for
some kinds of testing to allow the gui or command interface to override a
particular item so that the real hardware updates are stored but not actually
returned to other plugins or call callbacks.  It would have to be globally
tracked, able to be removed and indicated in the status for sure.

Does it make sense to track which plugin is writing to any particular database
item and flag when multiple plugins attempt to write to the same item.  Or
perhaps we have an item ownership system?  It'll probably work okay in the real
systems because it'll make sense, but it might be hard to troubleshoot issues
later if there are conflicts.

System status information like memory usage, average CPU utilization, etc.
This would depend on the psutils package and it might make sense for it to
be optional and only work if that package is there.

Add a sys path parameter to the configuration so the user can add a module
search path to the system for third party plugins.

The --config-file command line argument should allow for a single file name to
be given and the normal search for the filename to be carried out and the
config_path stored accordingly.  Also if a full or relative path is given then
that path should be stored in the config_path variable.

GUI Plugin

  Add Tree view for status

  Add trending capability


CAN-FIX Plugin
