X728 Plugin for UPS board
=========================

X728 is an UPS board that provides enough current to drive Raspberry Pi 5 along with the display.

Note that the plugin supports boards from V2.1 up. There's a minor change in GPIO pins in previous versions (see source code)

The plugin introduces following parameters:

* POWER_FAIL: true if is board is running from battery power
* BAT_REMAINING: Remaining battery power in percentage (0-100)
* BAT_VOLTAGE: Current battery voltage

configuration file supports single parameter "shutdown_after". If power is failed, shut down the computer after specified minutes. Comment out to disable.
